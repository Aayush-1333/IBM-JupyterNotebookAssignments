## IBM Data Science Professional Certification Assignments

This repository contains the assignments that I have done throughout the course offered by IBM Skills Network.

This contains the following assignments:
- Automobile Sales Analysis
- House Sales Analysis
- Stock Data WebScraping
- Falcon9 Data Science Capstone Project

These assignments focus on the data science lifecycle starting from problem definition all the way to deployment and monitoring. All the phases in the lifecycle are crucial for Data Scientists as it helps to find insights and create a solution to answer the problem statements for business use cases.

A typical data science lifecycle is as follows:
- Problem definition
- Data Collection
- Data Wrangling and EDA
- Data Visualization
- Model development
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment and Monitoring

All these phases can go back and forth depending on the situation and relevance towards the problem statement.
